        <h2>Lunch</h2>
        <p>Many great options for lunch</p>
        <h3>Tacos</h3>
        <p>A popular and very good favorite of many people.</p>
        <p>The first ingrediant you need is a tortilla. You need 1 cup of hamburger meat, 1/2 cup of shredded cheese, 1/2 cup of tomatoes and maybe some salsa if you are feeeling a little spicy. Put the tortilla on a plate then put all the ingediants on it. </p>

        <h3>Ricer Burrito</h3>
        <p>The ricer burrito is much like the taco. The only difference is after all the ingredients have been place on the tortilla, the burrito must be "slammed". Ie, make it as thin as possible. Take some nacho chesse and add racing stripe designs to the burrito and use toothpicks to make a spoiler. </p>

        <h3>Mexican Ricer Rice </h3>
        <p>This is a delicasy, much like a civic. Mess something up like exhaust, an you got rice. First, you need to cook up some rice. Then, add some stuff that makes it spicy. I would recommend crushed pepper.</p>

        <p>To make this dish, you need to cook up or roast some chicken to your liking. Cook the chicken and rice seperatly. When cooking the rice, add tomatoes, onions, and corn. Once both portions are done cooking, mix them together on a plate.</p>
